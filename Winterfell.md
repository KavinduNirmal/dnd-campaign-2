#continent

[[Winterfell]] is the name of the continent of the second campaign settings. The continent recived this name because of the weather of this continent. After **Historic Event?** this continent is ravaged by an eternal winter. The cold is something the citizens used to.

Because of the freezing weathers the production of most food has gone down, however  with the help of powerful [[arcane]] users and various other methods the kingdoms have evolved to surviving. 

There are many things wrong with this world, and weather is only one thing from the continuing list.
